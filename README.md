# Insurance Prediction using Linear Regression

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a data science project that focuses on predicting insurance charges using linear regression. The project utilizes a dataset comprising various factors such as age, BMI, number of children, and smoking status to train a linear regression model. The goal is to provide insights into the factors influencing insurance charges and create a predictive model for estimating future insurance costs.

## Introduction

Explain the goal of the project, the problem statement, and why predicting insurance charges is important. Provide a brief overview of the linear regression approach used for prediction.

## Dataset

Describe the dataset used for training the linear regression model. Include details about the features (independent variables) and the target variable (insurance charges). If possible, provide a link to the dataset.

## Data Exploration

Explore the dataset to gain insights into its structure, distributions, and relationships between variables. Use visualizations to present key findings.

## Data Preprocessing

Discuss any preprocessing steps applied to the data, such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

## Linear Regression Model

Explain the implementation of the linear regression model, including the features selected, training process, and any hyperparameter tuning performed.

## Evaluation Metrics

Describe the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the linear regression model. Common metrics for regression tasks include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

## Results

Present the results of the linear regression model, including insights into the factors influencing insurance charges and the predictive performance of the model.

## Dependencies

List the dependencies required to run the project. Include a `requirements.txt` file if applicable.

```bash
# Example installation command
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Provide instructions on how to use the project, including any scripts or notebooks available. Include information on how users can reproduce the results or perform their own predictions.

## Contributing
